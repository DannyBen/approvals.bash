# approvals.bash v0.2.1
#
# Interactive approval testing for Bash.
# https://github.com/DannyBen/approvals.bash
#
# This script will compare the output of a command with an expected output
# stored in the approvals folder.
# 
# - When the approval file does not exist, the actual output will be shown to
#   you, and you will be prompted to approve (and save) it.
# - When the approval file exists, but contains different data, the diff will
#   be shown to you, and you will be prompted to approve (and save) it.
# - When the approval file exists and contains matching data, the approval
#   test will pass.
# - When a new/updated approval is rejected, we will exit immediately with
#   exit code 1
# - When running in a CI environment (CI variable exists), we will run in non
#   interactive mode (so tests will fail automatically if they do not match).
#
# Usage
#   source approvals.bash
#   approve <command> [<approval file name>]
#
# Exapmple
#   approve "ls -s"
#   approve "ls -s" "ls_size"
